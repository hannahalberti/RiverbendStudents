We are selling millions of products worldwide every day, with several thousand products being added to our product line.\r\n",

Therefore, the quality of our product analysis depends heavily on the ability to accurately cluster similar products. The better the classification, the more insights we can generate about our product range.\r\n",

If your code is a Python Jupyter Notebook make sure you have a writeup explaining your solution. If your code is just a source code file, have an additional readme file outlining and discussing your solution.\r\n"
